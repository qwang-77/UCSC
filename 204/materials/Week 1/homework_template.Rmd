```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

\noindent 2. Consider the dataset **pressure**. Plot pressure vs. temperature.

\noindent (a) Plots pressure vs. temperature

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

\noindent (b) Provide a description of your plot. 

The plot shows that as temperature increases pressure also increases. The relationship between the two variables appears to be non-linear.
